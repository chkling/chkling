### Hi there! 💥

My name is Calvin Kling and I'm a Software Developer in the Atlanta, Georgia area. One of my favorite things about coding is mixing my creative and analytical sides together when tackling a problem or building something new! Outside of coding, I enjoy video games, staying active on a hiking trail or in the gym, and exploring new places, whether it's in my city or in another country.
